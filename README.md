Movie Recommender System based on Machine Learning
Overview
The project deploys a movie recommendation system based on machine learning algorithms in Python. The system compares user preferences and movie attributes to make personalized recommendations from a large dataset.
Dataset
The project uses an extensive movie dataset with:

50,000+ movies
100,000+ user ratings
Movie metadata (genre, cast, director, release date, etc.)
User demographic data

Features

Content-based filtering: Suggests movies similar to those the user has liked
Collaborative filtering: Recommends movies based on recommendations of like-minded users
Hybrid method: Merges both techniques for better recommendation accuracy
Generation of recommendations in real-time using algorithms with optimizations
Performance metrics to measure the quality of recommendations

Technologies Used

Python 3.9+
Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
Surprise library for collaborative filtering
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
